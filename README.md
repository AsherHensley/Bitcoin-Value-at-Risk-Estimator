# Bayesian-Nonparametrics-For-Volatility-Clustering-and-Prediction-with-Application-to-Bitcoin-Prices

This repositiory contains the code used to generate experimental results from the paper:

Hensley, Asher A., and Petar M. DjuriÄ‡. "Bayesian Nonparametrics for Volatility Clustering and Prediction with Application to Bitcoin Prices." European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), 2018 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2018 (submitted).

(see \_PAPER.pdf)

To generate synthetic data experiment results:
  1. run TRAIN\_SCRIPT\_synthetic.m
  2. run TEST\_SCRIPT\_synthetic.m
  
To generate Bitcoin experiment results:
  1. run TRAIN\_SCRIPT\_bitcoin.m
  2. run TEST\_SCRIPT\_bitcoin.m
  
Note: This code requires the Statistics Toolbox.
